Raspi_tracker: A Simple GPS Tracker for Rasberry
-------

# Description
Raspi_tracker is a simple GPS tracker with html viewer and client program to adjust the parameters. It was originally targeted Raspberry Pi (as display), but it **might** work with other Linux distros. 
In general, Raspi_tracker does not require re-compilation should work on an "out of the box" Raspberry Pi.

# Basic configuration

## Config Thingspeak channels and api key

Open a free account for small non-commercial projects
https://thingspeak.com/prices/thingspeak_home

Config your channel with 4 fields 'lat' 'long' 'alt' 'time':

![alt text](https://github.com/amerinoj/raspi_tracker/blob/master/img/thingspeak_fields.png?raw=true)
.

Get your api keys:

![alt text](https://github.com/amerinoj/raspi_tracker/blob/master/img/thingspeak_api_key.png?raw=true)
.

* Edit gps-traker.html and replace 'thing_url' and 'thing_key' with your url channel id and read api key. 


```
const thing_url = "https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/0000000/";
const thing_key = "api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```



* Edit raspi_tracker.conf

[upload]  

Configure 'url' with your thingspeak write api key. 
```
url = https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

[gps]

* Configure your gps device  parameters.
```
device_path =/dev/ttyACM0
baudrate = 11520
timeout = 50
gps_precision = 12
```




---------------------------------------------------------------------
## Config Google Maps api key

Open a free google account and create a google platform project.

Follow the next wiki:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

You need assigned  'Maps JavaScript API' in your project . if in addition you assigned  'Directions API' you can use 'driving' and 'walking' simulation in the map. But 'Directions API' has a payment restrincion or trial time.

![alt text](https://github.com/amerinoj/raspi_tracker/blob/master/img/google_api.png?raw=true)

* Edit gps-traker.html and replace 'src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key'  with your google url api key. 
```
<script  src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?keyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"></script>	
```


---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Advanced configuration
## Configure raspi_tracker settings

* Adjust config settings in  /opt/raspi_tracker/raspi_tracker.conf

[gps]

Configure your gps device  parameters.
```
device_path =/dev/ttyACM0
baudrate = 11520
timeout = 50
gps_precision = 12
```

[miscellanea]

If minimum_upload is enable the position will be update only if the gps target go out from the current assumption.
The current position is a perimeter calculated from current position plus gps accuracy
gps accuracy = gps_precision ^ Hdop
```
minimum_upload = True
```

[adaptative]

If adaptative_time is enable the refress_time under 'upload' is omite.
Adaptative time enable a dynamic calculated time to upload the possition to cloud.
The time depend on speed of the gps
```
adaptative_time = True
```
Enable a dynamic time value to upload data to cloud. The time is calculated with REFERENCE_METERS, put in REFERENCE_METERS(meters)
The others speed are derivated from this relate REFRESS_TIME=current_speed_in_m/s(36/REFERENCE_METERS).
The minumum_time define in seconds is the minimun time used when the calculated time is less than this
```
minimum_time = 2
reference_meters = 30
```
```
Reference table calculated for 25 meters, for 50km/h the position will be update every 9,6 seconds
Current km/h	      Current m/s		  REFERENCE_METERS	                REFRESS_TIME

```


[share]

The raspi tracker has a GUI client "client_tracker.pwc" to show the GPS parameters, these setting share the gps data between the two programs.
The traffic can be share in local machine or between two machines , define your bind ip address, port and interface.
```
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 6927
dev = lo
```

[debug]  

Change the debug level from 'info' to 'debug' to enable debug output
```
debug_level = debug
```
You can see the output debug on screen and the output is save in the file Raspi_Tracker_debug.txt defined under debug_file parameter
```
debug_file = Raspi_Tracker_debug.txt
```
Stop the service and run the program manually
```
sudo service raspi_tracker stop
sudo ./opt/raspi_tracker/raspi_tracker.py
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## Configure client_tracker settings

* Adjust config settings in  /opt/raspi_tracker/client/client_tracker.conf

[connection] 

Define the ip and port server than is share the data. 
```
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 6927
```
Define the network card used to reach the server
```
dev = lo
```


[debug]  

Change the debug level from 'info' to 'debug' to enable debug output.

You can see the output debug on screen and the output is save in the file Client_Tracker_debug.txt defined under debug_file parameter
```
debug_level = info
debug_file = Client_Tracker_debug.txt
```
To see the output in real time , stop the client and run from console 
```
sudo ./opt/raspi_tracker/client/client_tracker.pwc
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage

* Raspi_tracker.py is install as service unther raspi_tracker.service and comming run after the system is up. 
After configured the conf files reboot the system to run the service automatically or you can start the service manually.
```
sudo service raspi_tracker start
```
* To check if the services is running 
```
sudo service raspi_tracker status
```
* To upload the coordinates on cloud  is need an internet connection, you can use a 3g connection or other type.
See https://github.com/amerinoj/3gconnect

* Copy the gps-tracker.html in your PC and open it with Google Chrome o Firefox to see your tracker.
You can select your date from and to to paint the path. If the Thingspeak servers has data to the day appear in green color.
